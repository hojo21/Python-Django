# Python-Django
 Programming Language course project for implementing the Python packagae Django for a sample backend data base created to replecate the features for an online store. After taking Software Engineering, I have been pretty fascinated with web development and wanted to continue strengthening my skills in the area. I feel like most of my experience has been on Front-End development so I decided to focuse on Back-End which lead me to choose Python's web framework Django. After doing some research I found out that Python is one of the most common back-end languages and that Django is a very handy tool for that. The project I have created immitates the back-end servers for an online store where the owners can view and manage current orders using Django. Python is great for this specifically for it's simplistic and efficient design. Django also has many features included such as the admin board that make the website very clear and straightforward. 

 Directions:
 To run the development server on the local host, first you will need to navigate to the mysite1 directory. There are two that are both named "mysite1", you only need to go into the first directory. Once in this folder, be sure to have Python 3 installed onto your computer and run the command "python manage.py runserver" or "python3 manage.py runserver" if you have other versions of Python installed onto your computer. I used Python 3, the latest version of Visual Studio Code, and macOS to create and run this project. 

Once the server is running it should display a local url that you can use to access the website "http://127.0.0.1:8000/". After you navigate to this page you should see a page that says "Python Django Store Project" with a button "Create Customer" below. After clicking this button you will be navigated to the "Create Customer" page which is supposed to replicate a customer creating an account and placing an order. You can enter the customer's name and add the items they will be purchasing. After entering a customer name and pressing "Add items" you will be directed to the customer's personal page with the customer's name at the top where you can add the items that will be purchased. From here you can analyze the data in the back-end server by going to the admin page using the admin button to see the newly added data. The customer's name will be stored in the "Shopping carts" page and the items that all of the customers have purchased will be placed in the "Items" page. From there you can analyze all of the customer data. 

Differences from proposal:
One of the biggest differences from my project proposal was that I did not put much focus onto the front-end side of things because I was pretty drained after developing the back-end side. Because of this the front-end aspects of the website are very bare-bones but that the intentions of the project were for the back-end regardless. 

Files to focus on:
The files I did most of my writing/coding on were inside of the "store" directory specifically the files inside the templates folder and the .py files inside the store folder. More specific comments can be find on each of these files. 

Sample input/output:
This information should be able to be found on the admin page. Sample Shopping cart or Customer data: Customer1, Customer 2. Sample Items or purchased item data: Sweatshirt, T-Shirt.
